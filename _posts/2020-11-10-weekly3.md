## Time: 3:00 PM

## Attendees
- Sachinee Wijetilleke
- Nafisa Tabassum
- Linh Nguyen
- Svetlana Yanushkevich

## Meeting Notes

- Nafisa suggested pySAL library to compute spatial autocorrelation 
- Philip says it would be better if we minimized dependencies or used more native libraries in python such as pandas, numpy, scipy
- Philip didn’t use autocorrelation for his project
- We’re still doing autocorrelation because it’s the basis of the train paper
- Use flat floor plans like ENG203, Science theatres because elevation is a factor in spread of droplets
- ICT 121 floor plans are out for now
- Philip recommended manipulating vector graphic of floor plan to get measurements
- Linh and sachinee will work on formatting the floor plans, measurements, etc
- Decided it would be easier to just physically measure the distance between the seats
- Philip set up a slack channel for communication instead of email
