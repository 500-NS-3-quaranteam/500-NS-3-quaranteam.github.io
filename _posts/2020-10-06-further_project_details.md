    - start with 1/2 rooms within the ICT building
    - static model of infection given a particular # of people
    - other variables are: distance b/w people, disease prevention methods, how long they are in a certain area
    - temporal graph of infection probability
    - should be able to demo tool
- Be sure to specify probability of results, can never be 100% certain of results
