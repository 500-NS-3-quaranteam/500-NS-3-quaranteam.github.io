## Meeting Notes
- IP was discussed with the TA, all the work that we do for the supervisor is owned by the supervisor
- Need to discuss funding and IP with the supervisor
- Have a format agreement to ensure IP is respected and then we can use aspects of the project after
- Since it is a software project and we will be doing everything on our own, can include only the   costs that we think we might encounter, not much for us since the project is pretty self contained
- For technical specifications section, will ask a software-related TA and let us know
- TA says the GUI under technical specifications might be there by mistake
- Will ask Dr. Zareipour about the show “what you are doing and not how you are doing”
