## Time: 3:00 PM

## Attendees
- Svetlana Yanushkevich
- Philip Ciunkiewicz (MSc Student)
- Muhammad Farooq
- Sachinee Wijetilleke
- Abhijeet Jagdev
- Nafisa Tabassum
- Linh Nguyen

## Meeting Notes
- Would recommend setting up a REST django framework and then using angular or react in JS
- angular/react would link pretty well with D3.js
- Use Django for the bulk of it and then have angular communicate with it
- Angular is easier and allows u to do a lot more assuming you know Javascript
- Can develop a lot more complex apps than with django
- Django is limited in how you structure your frontend
- Angular/React FrontEnd
- Backend with Django
- Cool stuff in python to deal with graphs like NetworkX
- GitKraken/Github Pro
- Follow Djangoâ€™s Best practices for code structure
- Would be nice to have graphs in the interface as well, along with the heatmap
- Use a static model, the main thing we care about is geospatial spread. Worry about distance between individuals
- Dynamic makes things very difficult, have to worry about fluid dynamics, agent behaviour etc.
- Prefers us to use a static geometric distribution model
- Grid based system
- Good to display Health Canada/AHS room restrictions/requirement on the GUI
- Can try to use graph theory where we model the seated students as populated nodes on a graph
- And the distance between them is encoded in the edges, then have a connected graph and this would be a super dense representation
