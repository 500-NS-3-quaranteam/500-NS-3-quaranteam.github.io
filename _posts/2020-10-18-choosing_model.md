## Time: 1:00 PM

## Attendees
- Sachinee Wijetilleke
- Nafisa Tabassum
- Linh Nguyen

## Meeting Notes
- Decided that an agent-based model best fits our requirements
- The model will classify agents according to the SEIR epidemiological model instead of SIR
- Decided which user input variables will belong to the MVP (duration, distance between agents, number infected and PPE)
- Heatmap will identify which areas in the lecture room are hotspots for infection
- Finding the equation that fits our variables
- SEIR paper for infection rate and spatial autocorrelation for specific locations
