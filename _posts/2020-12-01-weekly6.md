## Time: 3:00 PM

## Attendees
- Muhammad Farooq
- Sachinee Wijetilleke
- Abhijeet Jagdev
- Nafisa Tabassum
- Linh Nguyen
- Svetlana Yanushkevich
- Philip Ciunkiewicz (MSc Student)

## Meeting Notes
- Linh and Sachinee discussed what they worked on, mode is computing moran's I values as well as testing the python results against the MATLAB results for verification.
- Linh and Sachinee calculated weights matrix and need to figure out how to get distances
- Nafisa demoed her functioning sidebar. 
- Usman demonstrated his updated heatmap using a new method than what was previously approached.
- Abhijeet demonstrated his updated work on the seat selection using a new approach which sends the coordinates of infected agents to the back end as a POST request with the x and y coordinates as a relative coordinate (% of width and height) along with the state of the selected seat
- Philip says randomly seating an infected person would be good but not for non-infected people; that will most likely be manual. Also good for testing purposes too
- Abhijeet can manually position nodes now given an (x,y) value, the location of the node is now relative to the width of the container instead of absolute pixels
- We would need a bounding box for a seat because canâ€™t do relative coordinates for weird geometry like the amphitheatre/radial type rooms
