## Time: 3:00 PM

## Attendees
- Muhammad Farooq
- Sachinee Wijetilleke
- Abhijeet Jagdev
- Nafisa Tabassum
- Linh Nguyen
- Svetlana Yanushkevich

## Meeting Notes
- Nafisa presented the DB architecture
- Do not worry about complex auth right now
- Usman updated them about the Database
- Abhijeet presented some front end examples of selecting seats
- Would not be a bad idea to overlap heatmap if there is not too much clutter and it is fast enough
- Can use asynchronous to overload tasks to another thread
- Hosted on the sponsors official lab website BT lab at UofC ucalgary.ca/btlab
- Will need very heavy involvement from IT to host the website through the bt lab
- University can most likely provide a DNS name for us to use for the website
- It is okay to start with just a model that considers distance between people (Directly from the train paper) spatial autocorrelation model
- Do not need a formal contract because we are working with a simulation and not proprietary data
- The final product will be owned by the biometrics lab as it will be worked on after our departure
- When using open source platforms, check what license they use, open source code license has terms, be careful of this, if we are using the library for our own project and do not pay for a licence then our project would also need to be open source
- Ask the TA/Prof if the university owns the project
- Will give funds for purchasing of licences or any computing services needed
- Want it to load everything within 3000ms
- Simulation should be fast enough that it is interactable and can do things in real time
- Realtime is 0.1s up to a maximum of 10s
- Accessibility (color-blindness, larger font etc.)
- Can use peers to try the application without instructions and see how their experience is
- Need a heatmap, ppe parameters, probabilities of getting infected
- Nice to have optimization of seating
- Dr. Yanushkevich suggested meeting weekly instead of bi-weekly
