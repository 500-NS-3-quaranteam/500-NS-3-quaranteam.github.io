## Time: 3:00 PM

## Attendees
- Muhammad Farooq
- Sachinee Wijetilleke
- Abhijeet Jagdev
- Nafisa Tabassum
- Linh Nguyen
- Svetlana Yanushkevich
- Philip Ciunkiewicz (MSc Student)

## Meeting Notes
- Discussed the design road map
    - Elaborate more on section 4 in road map
    - A couple options for deployment we can use along with AWS
    - Lab has a machine that could be used as a dedicated host
    - Can use this lab computer before we build it on AWS and start scaling it
    - Philip would suggest AWS over Heroku

- Need to pick up the linux box from lab
- Would suggest dockerizing the project, Philip can help with it
- Use it for development, even prior to deployment
- Nafisa showed her progress
- Will email IT to see if there is an API for Archibus/Room Selector
- Can save the floorplans in an instance, easier than having them saved in s3
- Could cache the heatmaps (only the underlying data which is a matrix)
- Try grabbing an image segmentation software that can identify primitive squares in one colour channel
- Identify based on where the pixels are coloured, python takes the mask and translates it to regions, use an intermediate tool to make life easier
- Having a bubble radius that the user can hover over on the floor plan so that they know the seat area for selection
- Defining and storing coordinates of seats in database
- If we do graph theory, we send/store K elements in the database where K is the selected seats either regular actor or infected
- Compute L2 distance (Euclidean) between nodes
- Temporal graph 1: attack rate (rate of actor getting infected) as a function of time, per actor
- Temporal graph 2: Not discussed
- Dr.Yanushkevich will also speak with the users (admin) that will actually use the application what other parameters they want to see
- In the end it is okay if we have a few rooms for our final prototype
