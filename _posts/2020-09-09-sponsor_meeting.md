## Meeting Notes

**Background**
- In her Biometric lab, were looking at the collection of data using multiple sensors, don't develop sensors, only collect data, and then perform data analytics on the data
- Started developing the data analytics for a couple years already
- Decision making algorithms in a smart way, analyzing cause and effect
- Make decisions, one step beyond just recognition
- Knowledge inference, predict/analyze the first wave of COVID
- When the next wave or infection comes, can update the data and use that to infer the data
- Variables of interest are: Infections, mortality rate, infection rate, breakdown data and how these different measures affect the data (such as wearing a mask etc.)
- Air quality, time of the year etc.
- Less risk of getting covid when inside
- Pay more attention to how HVAC systems are designed, filters are important when filtering out pathogens
- Can be applied to health applications, workplaces, healthcare, university etc.
- Analyze people place and numbers
- Give recommendation to management 
- Decision support system to management

**Paper Review**
- Software/Design Problem
- Not entirely research based
- How you design the program to support decisions
- Would possibly organize an experiment and then create an extra function of where students should go/not go
- Cannot do the experiment in the fall because no in person classes
- Can receive schematic of classroom from uni
- Could also use fake one to start
- Analyze classroom attack rate with and without intervention (mask)
- Could be a web based application (Interesting Graphical Representation, use libraries and use Python)
- Just design a prototype for the demonstrative quality
- Analyze and assure safety in general
- Create a heatmap with the number of infections after 5 days, 10 days etc.
- Can for sure create a map of the classroom, and using data from the papers and virus info 
- Using the stream model (more complicated)
- For now use a simpler model
- Finish interface by end of fall
- Use winter to test and QA and all that
- Can use TFDL data, essentially any study space
- Can provide papers or Python libraries used
- Minimal dependencies (no installation, works with ppl with no technical background)
- An interface (preferably web-based) which shows a simple heatmap based on the parameters (time of year, air quality) that have been inputted
- Evaluate the attack rate and assess the risk factor depending on multiple scenarios
- Different ways to represent the attack rate (ex rows/columns like in the paper), visualize the heat map over the blueprint and show the duration of distribution
- Interested in static position of people, if it goes well we can go into dynamic situation (socialization)
- If we decide to go with a certain distribution, show how many infected people over time (?)
