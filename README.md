## How to Create a Log Entry

1. The posts are located in the `/_posts` folder and are in Markdown format.
2. Create a file with the timestamp and name ie 
```
2020-10-01-post1.md
2020-10-02-post2.md
```
### Structure

All posts must begin with YAML Front Matter. Variables are set between the triple-dashed lines
```
---
title: title_of_post
tags: GroupMeeting
---
```
Tags are for whether the meeting was with the group or the sponsor

Each heading in the post uses heading 2 (##) in Markdown and titles are bold (*)
```
## Time:
